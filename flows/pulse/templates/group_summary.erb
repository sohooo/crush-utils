Read '<%= aggregate_path %>'.
Produce a weekly summary for the GitLab group '<%= group %>' (<%= window[:start] %>..<%= window[:end] %>).
Focus on:
- **Highlights & themes** across issues/MRs/commits
- **Top MRs** (impact, risk) and notable projects
- **Contributors** (from commits) with brief impact notes
- **CI health** from pipelines (failures vs successes, flaky signals if any)
- **Trends** vs previous week if signals exist in this file path (compare counts)
- **Risks & blockers**
- **Suggested focus for next week**

Format Markdown with sections and concise bullets. Avoid speculation; cite counts where available.
